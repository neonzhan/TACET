# TACET
A physical stress-reducing tag for personal use.
The main objective is for students aged 18-25 (i.e. University students).

In order to reduce stress, some design features are implemented:
- Detection of user movement (user is recommended to keep this device with them at all times for best personalisation and usability)
- Portability: Lightweight and small (card-sized), allowing for use anywhere
- App Connectivity: Increased gathering of data on the app, and an increased range of features to be used
- Customisability: Data gathered from using the product can be used to personalise and customise options, allowing it to adapt to the student's needs
- OLED Screen: Key information is displayed (i.e. Time, What session, How long left, What's next). This allows the user to have freedom from their phone,
if all key information about study periods and productivity are already shown on this device.
